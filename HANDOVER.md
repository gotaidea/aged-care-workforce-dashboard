# Aged Care Workforce Intelligence Dashboard — Codex Handover

**Date:** April 2026  
**Prepared by:** Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6)  
**Handed to:** Codex  
**Repo:** `dovida-stuff/aged-care-workforce-dashboard` — branch `main`

---

## Project overview

A real-time workforce intelligence dashboard for the Australian aged care sector. It pulls data from public Australian government APIs and job platforms, stores it in Supabase (Postgres), and displays it as a dark-theme React dashboard.

**Purpose:** Give aged care operators and policy people a single view of sector employment trends, wage growth, SEEK job ad volumes, AIHW workforce census metrics, and JSA occupation shortage status — all auto-refreshed via GitHub Actions CI.

**Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Recharts + Vite, deployed to Vercel
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres), public read-only via anon key
- **Pipeline:** Python 3.12 scripts, run on GitHub Actions schedule
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (daily + weekly workflows)

**What is NOT in the repo (gitignored):**
- `frontend/.env.local` — exists on disk, has the Supabase anon key
- `pipeline/.env` — exists on disk, has the Supabase service role key
- `frontend/node_modules/` — exists on disk, `npm install` already run (326 packages)

---

## What is working

- All code merged to `main` and pushed to remote
- Supabase schema deployed — 7 tables, RLS policies, indexes, `updated_at` triggers all in place
- `frontend/.env.local` and `pipeline/.env` created with live Supabase credentials
- `npm install` complete — `frontend/node_modules/` present on disk
- Vite dev server starts successfully (`npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0` from `frontend/`)
- Full dashboard UI structure is correct — dark theme, news ticker, care type filter, all chart sections
- AIHW and JSA sections show hardcoded fallback data immediately (no pipeline run needed)
- All other sections show "No data" / skeleton loaders gracefully while Supabase tables are empty
- GitHub Actions workflows are wired up and will run on schedule once secrets are added

---

## What is NOT working

### 1. Windows localhost connection refused (blocker for local preview)

`npm run dev` on the Linux host (WSL2 or Codex sandbox) starts Vite fine and binds to `0.0.0.0:3000`. The Windows browser then refuses the connection.

**Root cause:** WSL2 runs in a lightweight VM with its own network namespace. Windows does not automatically forward WSL2 ports to localhost.

**Fix options (try in order):**

Option A — open the Network IP directly. Vite prints two URLs on start:
```
Local:   http://localhost:3000/
Network: http://192.0.2.x:3000/    ← open THIS one in Windows browser
```

Option B — add a WSL2 port-forwarding rule (run once in admin PowerShell):
```powershell
$wslIp = (wsl hostname -I).Trim()
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=$wslIp
```
Then `http://localhost:3000` will work in Windows.

Option C — use `localhost.run` or `npx localtunnel --port 3000` for a temporary public URL.

### 2. No live data in the dashboard

The data pipeline has never been run. ABS, SEEK, and RSS sections show empty state. Fix: run the pipeline (see next steps).

### 3. GitHub Actions CI not yet active

The workflows exist but `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` have not been added as GitHub repo secrets yet, so the scheduled runs will fail silently.

---

## Next steps in order

### Step 1 — Confirm UI works (fix localhost)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
# Note the "Network:" IP in output and open it in Windows browser
```

### Step 2 — Seed the database
```bash
cd pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_all.py
# Then check Supabase Table Editor — rows should appear in employment_data, wage_data, etc.
```

### Step 3 — Deploy frontend to Vercel
```
1. vercel.com → Add New Project → Import Git Repository
2. Select: dovida-stuff/aged-care-workforce-dashboard
3. Set root directory to: frontend
4. Framework preset: Vite
5. Environment Variables:
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL  = https://rmebcckenesgzhtshrcb.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = (from frontend/.env.local)
6. Deploy
```

### Step 4 — Add GitHub Actions secrets
```
GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret

SUPABASE_URL        = https://rmebcckenesgzhtshrcb.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY = (from pipeline/.env)

Then: Actions tab → weekly.yml → Run workflow  (seeds data immediately)
```

After Step 4, the dashboard is fully live and self-updating.

## Gotchas

### ABS API dimension codes may need adjustment
`abs_labour_force.py` and `abs_wpi.py` use SDMX-JSON dimension keys that were written from ABS API documentation without a live test run. If the scripts return empty datasets, the dimension key strings (measure, industry, region) need to be verified against the ABS API Explorer at `https://api.data.abs.gov.au/`. The scripts have comments indicating which variables to adjust.

### SEEK scraper may be blocked
`seek_scraper.py` hits SEEK's internal search API endpoint. SEEK has no public API and this endpoint may return 403 or break without notice. If blocked:
- Check SEEK Labour Market Insights for manually downloadable data
- Or skip SEEK and remove it from `run_all.py` FETCHERS list temporarily

### `vercel.json` root vs `frontend/` root
`vercel.json` is in the repo root but the actual Vite project is in `frontend/`. When importing to Vercel, explicitly set the **root directory** to `frontend` — otherwise Vercel will try to build from the repo root and fail.

### `.env.local` and `.env` are gitignored — they exist on disk only
These files are on disk in the Codex environment but will not appear in a fresh `git clone`. If working in a new environment, recreate them:
```
frontend/.env.local:
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://rmebcckenesgzhtshrcb.supabase.co
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key — get from Supabase dashboard: Settings → API>

pipeline/.env:
  SUPABASE_URL=https://rmebcckenesgzhtshrcb.supabase.co
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<service role key — get from Supabase dashboard: Settings → API>
```

### `useQuery` dependency array is manual
`src/hooks/useQuery.js` takes a `deps` array as second argument (mirrors `useEffect`). The `eslint-disable` comment suppresses the exhaustive-deps warning deliberately — the hook is designed this way so callers control re-fetch triggers (e.g. care type filter changes).

### Care type filter affects only two sections
`CareTypeFilter` in `App.jsx` re-fetches `fetchEmploymentTrend(careType)` and `fetchJobAdTrend(careType)` on toggle. The WPI chart, shortage table, and news ticker are not affected by the filter — this is intentional (ABS and JSA data is not broken out by care type in the source data).

### AIHW and JSA fallback data is hardcoded for 2023
The fallback rows in `aihw_scraper.py` and `jsa_scraper.py` use period `2023-01-01`. Once a live pipeline run inserts newer rows, the UI will prefer those. The fallbacks are only there so the UI isn't completely empty on first load.

## V2 backlog (not started)

- Provider intelligence section — manual data entry form for headcount, turnover, wage expense per provider
- Annual report PDF agent — automated extraction from provider PDF annual reports
- Geographic heatmap — state-level job ad volume (data model already has `job_ads.state` column)
- Role-level salary benchmarks — SEEK salary data or recruitment agency guides
- Mobile-optimised layout
- LinkedIn / Indeed job ad data as SEEK fallback
